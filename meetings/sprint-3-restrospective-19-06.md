### Sprint Retrospective
###### 19 June 2019
Everyone feels that they did not do that much work as much as they would normally have
due to impending tests. 

Sara: Before we felt we had a lot of time to finish the project. Now we feel that
we need to hurry up. 

The team agrees to put in more time in the form of some 8 hour days. 

Andrew feels that we need to think more about what we need to prioritize. 

Marten mentions that Freek worked for the entire sprint on error handling. This 
is nice, but it does not immediately improve the final product. 

The team vows to focus only on features and design. Obviously bug fixing is still
a priority.
