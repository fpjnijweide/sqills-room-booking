### Sprint 2 Retrospective
###### 05 June 2019 09:00
*Andrew is not present as he is not feeling well.*

Freek: We stayed focused on the task during the sprint.

Marten: We made sure everything we did contributed to the goals
of this sprint.

Platon: Our cooperation improved since last sprint. We all got more used to working
with each other. 

Marten: The order in which we handled tickets was problematic. We started with front-end
sometimes and ended with back-end. This caused issues as the code that you relied on for the frond-end
changed, breaking a lot of things. Freek mentioned that we improved this in the second half of the sprint.
Next sprint, we aim to do the tickets in such an order that the issue mentioned here does not occur again. 

Marten: We wrote unittests, but these ended up not working because the code they were testing changed a lot and 
we had no time to update the tests all the time. Testing should be done in the later stages of the sprint.

Platon: We should focus on the front-end styling according to the feedback. Freek mentions there is not a lot of back-end
stuff to do. Maybe we should finish all of this and then focus completely on the front-end.
